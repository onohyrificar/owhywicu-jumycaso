Overview
Itâ€™s up to a team of unlikely heroes to stop zombie Super Heroes and Super Villains from destroying the world in this time-travel horror adventure
 
 The Incident has infected the planet, creating zombified Super Heroes who destroy everything they swore to protect. Doctor Strange realizes the plague cannot be allowed to spread to other realities, but his Hunger is irresistible...
 
 Now Earthâ€™s only hope is the Sanctum Sanctorum librarian, Zelma Stanton. She knows every spell in the book, but sheâ€™s no fighter. Enter witch Nico Minoru, monster hunter Elsa Bloodstone, and Deadpool. They plan to trap the zombies in a time loop, but it goes horribly awry (thanks, Deadpool), crushing a million butterflies, and the timeline unravels, making the original Incident look like a cakewalk. Itâ€™s going to take magic bullets, bloodstones, and brains to fix this flesh-eating nightmare.
