 When a divorced woman attends a sleepaway camp for adults, sheÂ reconnects with a man from her pastâ€”only to fallÂ head over heels for his sister instead.Â 
 Â 
 Garland Moore used to believe in magic, the power of optimism, and signs from the universe. Then her husband surprised her with divorce papers over Valentine&#039;s Day dinner. Now Garland isnâ€™t sure what to believe anymore, except that sheâ€™s clearly never meant to love again. When new friends invite her to spend a week at their reopened sleepaway camp, she and her sister decide itâ€™s an opportunity to enjoy the kind of summer getaway they never had as kids. If Garland still believed in signs, this would sure seem like one. Summer camp is a chance to let go of her past and start fresh.
 Â 
 Nestled into the picturesque Blue Ridge Mountains, Camp Carl Cove provides the exact escape Garland always dreamed of, until she runs into Masonâ€”the man she had a premonition about after one brief meeting years ago. No matter how she tries to run, the universe appears determined to bring love back into Garlandâ€™s life. She even ends up rooming with Masonâ€™s sister Stevie, a vibrant former park ranger who is as charming as she is competitive. The more time Garland spends with Stevie, the more the signs confuse her. The stars are aligning in a way Garland never could have predicted.
 Â 
 Amid camp tournaments and moonlit dances, Garland continues to be pulled toward the beautiful blonde outdoorswoman who makes her laugh and swoon. Summer camp doesnâ€™t last forever, but if Garland can learn to trust her heart, the love she finds there just might.
