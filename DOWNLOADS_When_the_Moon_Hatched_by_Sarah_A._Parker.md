Overview
The Creators did not expect their beloved dragons to sail skyward upon their end. To curl into balls just beyond gravity&#039;s grip, littering the sky with tombstones. With moons. They certainly did not expect them to fall. As a valued Elding Blade of the rebellion group FÃ­ur du Ath, Raeve&#039;s job is to kill. To complete orders and never get caught. When a renowned bounty hunter is employed by The Crown to capture a member of the Ath, Raeve&#039;s world is turned upside down. Blood spills, hearts break, and Raeve finds herself at the mercy of the Guild of Nobles-a group of dual-beaded elementals who intend to turn her into a political statement. Only death will set her free. Crushed beneath a mourning weight, Kaan Vaegor took the head of a king and donned his melted crown. Now on a tireless quest to assuage the never-ebbing ache in his chest, his hunt for a moonshard lures him into the belly of Gore&#039;s notorious prison where he stumbles upon something that rips apart his perception of reality. A shackled miracle with eyes full of rage and blood on her hands. The echo of the past sings louder than the Creators themselves, and even Raeve can&#039;t ignore the truths blaring at her from a warmer, happier time. However. There&#039;s more to this song than meets the eye, and some truths ... They&#039;re too poisonous to swallow. When the Moon Hatched is a fast-paced fantasy romance for fans of witty banter and strong, sassy protagonists. Beneath the cover is an immersive, vibrant world with mysterious creatures, a unique magic system, and a love that blazes through the ages.
