In 1755, British Major General Braddock led an army of 2,400 soldiers, including a young Colonel George Washington and Daniel Boone, to retake Fort Duquesne from the French and seize control of the American Frontier-The French &amp;amp; Indian War. Yet, carried by this formidable force was a treasure-gold to be used as payroll for troops and gifts to win over native allies. Its protection throughout the perilous journey, through steep mountains and dense wilderness, weighed heavily on the General&amp;#039;s mind. Ever since The Battle of the Monongahela, where the French ambushed Braddock&amp;#039;s forces and mortally wounded him, Braddock&amp;#039;s puzzling orders for a hasty, complete retreat from an inferior force have driven rumors he desperately sought to recover the treasure he hid for its protection, but instead, took its location to his grave. Over the centuries, legends swirled around Braddock&amp;#039;s lost gold, worth a fortune today. The tales of its hiding place, stretching the length of Braddock&amp;#039;s tedious and precarious march from Western Maryland to Southwestern Pennsylvania, have persisted. Fast forward to today-Join Jack Sullivan and his companions in a heart-pounding quest as they decipher cryptic clues, brave treacherous traps, race against time, and battle aggressive adversaries. Will Jack&amp;#039;s bonds with his friends withstand the ultimate test, or will their pursuit of wealth cost them everything, including their lives?
